The AAPL stock data was collected from Yahoo Finance in the form of a CSV file on Excel from the period September 1st 2018-2013. The file was then imported into MySQL under the schema finance_data for data query analyis. 

Here I present MySQL queries for key statictics of AAPL stock over the 5 year period September 1st 2018-2023.

Averga_Close_Price: '114.3373'

MySQL Query:
SELECT AVG(Close) AS Average_Close_Price FROM aapl_data; 

Maximum_Close_Price: '196'  Minimum_Close_Price: '36'

MySQL Query: 
SELECT MAX(Close) AS Maximum_Close_Price, MIN(Close) AS Minimum_Close_Price FROM aapl_data;

Total_Trading_Volume: '136443886900'

MySQL Query: 
SELECT SUM(Volume) AS Total_Trading_Volume FROM aapl_data; 

Calculate a 50-day moving average for the closing price

MySQL Query: 
SELECT Date, Close, AVG(Close) OVER (ORDER BY Date ROWS BETWEEN 49 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS '50_Day_MA' FROM aapl_data;

Result: Presents table of Date, Close and 50_Day_MA. 

Calculate standard deviation for the closing price over a 50-day window

MySQL Query: 
SELECT Date, Close, STDDEV(Close) OVER (ORDER BY Date ROWS BETWEEN 49 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS '50_Day_Volatility' FROM aapl_data;

Result: Presents table of Date, Close, 50_Day_Volatility. A higher standard deviation indicates higher volatility.

Calculate daily price change and returns

MySQL Query: 
SELECT Date, Close,
       LAG(Close, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Date) AS Previous_Close,
       Close - LAG(Close, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Date) AS Daily_Change,
       (Close - LAG(Close, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Date)) / LAG(Close, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Date) AS Daily_Return
FROM aapl_data;

Result: Presents a table of Date, Close, Previous_Close, Daily_Change, Daily_Return.
